# Farkle #

## Rules ##
Farkle is a game typically played with six dice and more than one player. The traditional rules dictate that each player takes turns rolling the dice in succession, with each turn producing a score. The score produced from the players current turn is added to that players previous score accumulation. The goal is to be the first player to reach 10,000 points. The scoring is generated as follows:

1. At the beginning of the turn, the player rolls all 6 dice.

2. Scoring for each roll is as follows: Each 1 = 100 points, each 5 = 50 points, (3) 1s = 1000 points, (3) 2s = 200 points, (3) 3s = 300 points, (3) 4s = 400 points, (3) 5s = 500 points, and (3) 6s = 600 points, a straight = 1000 points, and more than three of a kind doubles the value for each additional match (e.g. (5) 3s = 300 x 2 x 2 = 1200 points).

3. Dice resulting in a score are chosen and removed by the player (the player must pick up at least one scoring die, but does not need to pick up all scoring die), and the player decides if they want to roll with the remaining dice or pass to the next

4. At least one die must be set aside after each roll.

5. A “farkle” occurs when a roll results in no points. All points accrued during that turn are forfeit, and play is passed to the

6. If the player has scored all six dice, he or she can roll again with all six dice.

7. Once a player has reached the winning point total, each successive player has one last chance to score enough points to surpass the leader.

This version will be a standalone application utilizing a graphic user interface. This game will have both a single and two player version, with the second player in two player mode being either a live player or a computer player. The computer player will use specific rules and probability to determine which dice to keep on each roll and to determine whether or not to roll again on a given turn.

The rules for the single player version will vary from the traditional rules by limiting the number of turns the player can take, with the goal being to beat a previous high score.
